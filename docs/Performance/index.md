## Performance

This chapter focuses on asynchronous backend OData calls. It shows how you can make your OData calls "Promise ready".

### Normal ECMAScript 5 Projects

Find out how to wrap your OData calls with [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Promises) and make use of the Promise Chain feature.

### Modern ECMAScript 6 Projects

> Requires modern Browsers

If your project uses modern JavaScript, you can consume Promises using the [Async / Await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await) pattern and handle OData calls as if they where synchronous.
