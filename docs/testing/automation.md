# Automating tests

In the process of sustained quality assurance, running tests of all scopes (unit, integration, end-to-end) automatically provides the basis for Continuous Integration.

There are several infrastructures to utilize for automated test runs, with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [GitLab Pipelines](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/) and [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/get-started-with-bitbucket-pipelines/) some of the most prominent ones.
