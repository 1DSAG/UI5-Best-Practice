## Routing and Navigation

SAPUI5 offers hash-based navigation, which allows you to build single-page apps where the navigation is done by changing the hash. In this way the browser does not have to reload the page; instead there is a callback to which the app and especially the affected view can react. A hash string is parsed and matched against patterns which will then inform the handlers.

> **_NOTE:_** SAPUI5 uses [Crossroads.js](https://millermedeiros.github.io/crossroads.js/) for parsing the hash and the Hasher framework for manipulating the hash.

In SAPUI5, navigation and routing is implemented using a “router” (`sap.m.routing.Router` or `sap.ui.core.routing.Router`) to forward the hash change and the data in the hash to one or more views of the app.

You use **routes** to notify your application that the hash has changed to a certain value. For each route, you define the **pattern** that can be used in the app implementation.

With **targets**, you define where a view or a component is loaded and where the view or component is shown on the UI. By referring to one or multiple targets in a route's definition, you can load and show the views or components once the route's pattern matches the current hash.
