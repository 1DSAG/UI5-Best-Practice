# DSAG's UI5 best practice guide

this is not the guide itself (it's over at <https://1dsag.github.io/UI5-Best-Practice/>), but the corresponding repository with instructions on how to contribute to the guide.

Because **the DSAG UI5 best practice guide is a living document** üë®‚Äçüíª - thriving on and with its' community ü•≥

The document is written in (github flavored) `markdown` and served via `jekyll` in `github pages` (<https://1dsag.github.io/UI5-Best-Practice/>). So the recommended contribution approach is to

- fork the repo + create new branch locally
- run the guide locally (`bundle exec jekyll serve`).  
  write, edit, code (most likely in `/docs/**/*`).  
  repeat.
- push local branch to your fork, create a PR, assign a reviewer
- üôå

You'll find more detailed instructions on each of the above below.

- switch to the document base
  `$> cd docs`
- `$> bundle install`  
  for installing the `github-pages` jekyll incarnation
- start the local gh-pages instance, including automatic browser live-reload

  ```shell
  bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
  Configuration file: /Users/you/UI5-Best-Practice/docs/_config.yml
              Source: /Users/you/UI5-Best-Practice/docs
         Destination: /Users/you/UI5-Best-Practice/docs/_site
   Incremental build: disabled. Enable with --incremental

## linting of markdown content

Any markdown content (in `/docs/**/*`) is linted via [`markdownlint`](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) both for quality assurance and convenience.  
For quality assurance, to have the markdown-files max standard compliant, so subsequent processing and exporting is possible without running into formatting issues.  
For convenience, because small markdown formatting mistakes are automatically fixed via the `markdownlint` upon commit - the `markdownlint` [`cli`](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli) injects those fixes prior to the git commit, so don‚Äôt be surprised üòâ

## git commit messages

commit messages are linted in order to allow for automatic later processing into `CHANGELOG` et al documents.  
The linting occurs against the standards defined in the ["conventional commit" guidelines](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional), based on [the Angular project ones](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

The structure of a "conventional commit" message looks like:

```text
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

`<type>` can be any of

- build
- ci
- chore
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- style
- test

So a minimal commit message could look like...

`feat: added basic testing chapter`

‚Ä¶while a maxed out one might look like:

```text
fix: correct minor typos in code

see the issue for details on typos fixed.
additionally, replaced the dreaded ortho-""
with straight/standard ones.

Please refer to the [conventional commits website](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for more details on all the possibilities of formatting a git commit message.

## example PR-based workflow

0. fork the repo  
   ![fork a github project](img/00-fork.png)

1. clone your fork into your local development environment  
   ![clone the forked project](img/05-clone-fork.png)

2. create a new local git branch  
   ![create new local git branch](img/10-new-branch.png)

3. write, edit, code (most likely `markdown` content in `/docs/**/*`.  
   üë®‚Äçüíª  
   repeat.

   `git commit` early, `git commit` often  
   &rarr;¬†watch out for the commit linting (see [git commit messages](#git-commit-messages))  
   &rarr;¬†enjoy the convenience of auto-markdown-linting (see [linting of markdown content](#linting-of-markdown-content))

4. if applicable, [clean up your git commit history](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2018/06/07/keeping-git-commit-history-clean/#situation-3-i-need-to-add-remove-or-combine-commits)

5. push the local branch to your fork

6. submit a pull request (PR)  
   ![create a pull request on github](img/30-create-PR.png)

7. write the PR message similar to the [git commit messages](#git-commit-messages), so `squash`-merging gets easy for the maintainers  
   ![nice pull request message](img/31-PR-message.png)
   if applicable, referenc open issues in your commit message (<https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword>)

8. add a reviewer to the PR  
   ![add a reviewer to the pull request](img/35-PR-reviewer.png)

9. Changes necessary after the PR was created?  
   Simply commit to the branch of your fork  
   &rarr;¬†the PR gets updated automatically  
   &rarr; move the PR into `draft` mode until ready (then move to `ready for review`)

10. PR review process successfully completed?  
    Then the PR will be merged by any of the maintainers and it‚Äôs time for üéâ
